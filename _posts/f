I was reading this lecture note by Csaba, where he mentioned for every
policy, there exists a stationary policy with the same value. However,
he just briefly gave a hint about the form such stationary policy. In
this blog, mostly inspired by (Syed et. al 2008), I will write
the proof of such claim using the notion of Bellman Flow Constraints.

The problem of Markov Decision Processes is to find the optimal set of
actions $a_t\in {\cal A}_{t}$ in each time $t$ where we have states
$s\in {\cal S}_t$, to maximize the return
$R = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r(a_t|s_t)$, where $r(s_t, a_t)$ is an
immediate discounted reward in time $t$ for current-state/chosen-action
pair $(s_t, a_t)$. Furthermore, the environment response to the action
is encoded as $p(s_{t+1}|s_t, a_t)$. Such a behavior for the environment
and rewards makes us name this process a 'Markov Decision Process'.

The policy is the set of functions in each time $\pi=\{\pi_t\}_t$ from
previous history of states
$(s_0, \ldots, s_t)\in {\cal S}_0\times \ldots \times {\cal S}_t$ to a
distribution on actions, which by abuse of notation we refer to as
$\pi_t(a_t|s_1, \ldots, s_t)$. A policy is Markov, if the functions are
only functions of the last state $s_t$. If a policy is memoryless and
$\pi_1=\pi_2=\ldots$, then the policy is **stationary**. Further, we set
a distribution $\mu$ on initial states of the process.

To simplify our calculations, we define **occupancy measure** for a
policy as below $$\begin{aligned}
        v_{\mu}^{\pi}(s, a)= \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\gamma^t p_{\mu}^{\pi} (s_t=s, a_t=a),
     \end{aligned}$$ where $p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_t=s, a_t=a)$ is the
probability that with initial distribution $\mu$ and policy $\pi$, in
time $t$, we face state $s$ and we take action $t$.

Then, we can rewrite the expected return, also referred as value
function for the policy $\pi$ and initial distribution $\mu$, as

$$\begin{aligned}
        v^{\pi}(\mu) &= \mathbb{E}_{\mu, \pi}\Big[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r( s_t, a_t)\Big] = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t \sum_{s, a}r( s, a) p(s_t=s, a_t=a)\\
        &=  \sum_{s, a} r(s, a)\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\gamma^t p(s_t=s, a_t=a) = \sum_{s, a} r(s, a) v_{\mu}^{\pi}(s, a)\\
        &:= \langle r, v_{\mu}^{\pi}\rangle.
     \end{aligned}$$

Such a mathematical argument concludes that to calculate the value
function, one only needs to have the occupancy measure in hand.
Moreover, it shows that to optimize the value function one needs to
align the occupancy measure vector to the reward vector as much as
possible.

Then we go to the main problem, which is, for every policy $\pi$, there
is a stationary policy $\overline{\pi}$ with the same value function.
Using above discussion, to prove such a statement, we only need to prove
that the occupancy measure of $\pi$ and $\overline{\pi}$ are equal.

For showing the equality, first we define **$\overline{\pi}$-specific
Bellman's flow constraints** for a function (vector) $x(s, a)$,
stationary policy $\overline{\pi}(a|s)$, environment dynamics
$p(s'|s, a)$, and initial distribution $\mu(s)$ as below
$$\begin{aligned}
        x(s, a)&\geq 0\\
        x(s, a)&= \overline{\pi}(a|s)\mu(s) +\gamma \overline{\pi}(a|s)\sum_{s', a'} x(s', a')p(s|s', a').\label{eqn: pispecific}
     \end{aligned}$$ Further, we say $x(s, a)$ satisfies general form of
**Bellman's flow constraints** if $$\begin{aligned}
        x(s, a)&\geq 0\\
        \sum_{a}x(s, a)&= \mu(s) +\gamma \sum_{s', a'} x(s', a')p(s|s', a').
     \end{aligned}$$

Note: Every function that satisfies $\pi$-specific Bellman's flow
constraints, also satisfies general form of Bellman's flow constraints.

Next, we proceed proving the equality in the following steps:

1.  **The occupancy measure of a stationary policy $\overline{\pi}(a|s)$
    is the unique solution of $\pi$-specific Bellman's flow
    constraints.**

2.  **Every stationary policy $\overline{\pi}(a|s)$ and its occupancy
    measure $v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi}}(s, a)$ satisfy the equation
    $\overline{\pi}(a|s) = \frac{v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi}}(s, a)}{\sum_{a} v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi}}(s, a)}$.**

3.  **Every occupancy measure satisfies Bellman's flow constraints.**

4.  **Every function $x(s, a)$ that satisfies Bellman's flow constraint
    is an occupancy measure of a stationary policy
    $\overline{\pi}(a|s)=\frac{x(s, a)}{\sum_{a}x(s, a)}$.**

5.  **For every policy $\pi$, the occupancy measure
    $v_{\mu}^{\pi}(s, a)$ is also the occupancy measure of stationary
    policy
    $\overline{\pi}(s|a)=\frac{v_{\mu}^{\pi}(s, a)}{\sum_{a}v_{\mu}^{\pi}(s, a)}$.**

Let's go to each step:

1.  First we prove the occupancy measure
    $v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi}}(s, a)$ is a solution of
    $\overline{\pi}$-specific Bellman's constraints. We already know
    that the occupancy measure is positive. Hence, it is remained to
    show [\[eqn: pispecific\]](#eqn: pispecific){reference-type="eqref"
    reference="eqn: pispecific"}. One can rewrite
    $v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi}}(s, a)$ as $$\begin{aligned}
                v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi}}(s, a)&= \mu(s)\overline{\pi}(a|s)+\gamma\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_{t+1}=s, a_{t+1}=a)\\
                &=\mu(s)+\gamma\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t \sum_{s', a'}p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_t=s', a_t=a') p(s|s', a') \overline{\pi}(a|s)
                \\&= \mu(s)\overline{\pi}(a|s)+\gamma\overline{\pi}(a|s) \sum_{s', a'}  p(s|s', a')\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_t=s', a_t=a')
                \\&= \mu(s)\overline{\pi}(a|s)+\gamma \overline{\pi}(a|s)\sum_{s', a'} p(s|s', a')v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi}}(s', a'), \label{eqn: occupancy_bellman}
             \end{aligned}$$ which shows that the occupancy measure is a
    solution of $\overline{\pi}$-specific Bellman's flow constraints.

    You might then wonder why don't we have more solutions? The idea is
    simple. One can rewrite $\overline{\pi}$-specific Bellman's flow
    equality as $Ax=b$ where $A$ has elements $$\begin{aligned}
                A_{sa, s'a'}=\left\{\begin{array}{c c}
                    1-\gamma \overline{\pi}(a|s)p(s|s' a') & s'a'=sa,\\
                    -\gamma \overline{\pi}(a|s)p(s|s' a') & o.w.
                \end{array}\right.
             \end{aligned}$$ Then, one can simply show the absolute sum
    of non-diagonal elements of the matrix over $(s, a)$ is less than
    diagonal element of the column. Then, we can use Gershgorin's circle
    theorem which explains the eigenvalues of a matrix are inside a
    circle with the center of diagonal elements and radius of sum of
    non-diagonal elements. Then we can see that the matrix $A$ does not
    have any zero-valued eigenvalue, and hence, it is non-singular, and
    has at most one solution.

2.  Using previous section, we know that $v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi}}$
    satisfies $\overline{\pi}$-specific Bellman's flow constraints, and
    consequently general form of Bellman's flow constraints which can be
    written as $$\begin{aligned}
                v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi}}(s, a) = \mu(s) +\gamma \sum_{s', a'} p(s|s', a') v_{\mu}^{\overline{\pi} }(s', a').
             \end{aligned}$$ Using this fact and
    [\[eqn: occupancy\_bellman\]](#eqn: occupancy_bellman){reference-type="eqref"
    reference="eqn: occupancy_bellman"} one can prove the second step.

3.  Similar to the first step, we rewrite the occupancy measure and show
    the statement $$\begin{aligned}
                \sum_{a} v_{\mu}^{\pi}(s, a)&=\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_t = s)\\& = \mu(s)+\gamma \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t \sum_{s', a'}p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_{t}=s', a_{t}=a')p(s|s', a')\\
                &=\mu(s)+\gamma\sum_{a', s'} v_{\mu}^{\pi}(s', a')p(s|s', a').
             \end{aligned}$$ Note that in the first equality
    $p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_t=s)=\sum_{a} p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_t=s, a_t=a)$, and the
    second equality is true, because $p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_0=s) =\mu(s)$ and
    $$p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_{t+1}=s, a_{t+1}=a) = \sum_{s', a'}p_{\mu}^{\pi}(s_{t}=s', a_{t}=a')p(s|s', a').$$

4.  Since

    $$\begin{aligned}
     \overline{\pi}(a|s)= \frac{x(s, a)}{\sum_{a} x(s, a)} = \frac{x(s, a)}{\mu(s)+\gamma \sum_{s', a'} x (s', a') p (s|s', a')}, \end{aligned}$$

    then $x(s, a)$ satisfies $\overline{\pi}$-specific Bellman flow
    constraint, which using the first step, $x(s, a)$ is the occupancy
    measure of $\overline{\pi}$.

5.  Using the third step, the occupancy measure satisfies general form
    of Bellman's flow constraints. Then using the fourth step, it is
    also an occupancy measure of the mentioned stationary policy. Hence,
    the statement is proved.
