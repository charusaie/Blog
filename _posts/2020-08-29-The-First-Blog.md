Here I write down my first post in this blog. Time is `00:05` and I need to bike to my home after writing this very short post.

This blog post was the thing I was thinking for a long time. However, I guess right now is the best timing to start this blog which hopefully will be updated each two weeks.

I am interested in `math` and also trying to wander around `ML` topics that I find interesting. Hence, the topics in this blog will also be similar.

Less than two weeks, my first blog on [maximum differential entropy][max-ent] for a class of random variables. 


[max-ent]:     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy
